# Technologies and Architecture

This document is the current technical overview for the TimePro CLI and MCP host. It covers the technology stack, main design patterns, and data flow.

## Architecture Overview

Editable source: [architecture-diagram.excalidraw](architecture-diagram.excalidraw)

The TimePro Web API is the source system. The CLI and MCP host call that API using local tenant configuration. AI agents can use the CLI directly, call the MCP host, or use direct HTTP access when separately configured. Agents may also use local workspace tools such as files, Git, GitHub, and Azure DevOps alongside TimePro data.

The application is a local command-line tool. It does not host a web app or database. It reads local configuration, calls the existing TimePro HTTP API, and prints either human-friendly terminal output or machine-readable JSON.

## Technology Stack

| Area | Technology | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Runtime | .NET 10 (`net10.0`) | Packaged as a global `dotnet` tool named `tp`. |
| CLI framework | Spectre.Console.Cli | Command parsing, settings, help text, and command dispatch. |
| Terminal UI | Spectre.Console | Tables, markup, prompts, and confirmation flows. |
| Dependency injection | Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection | Shared service registration for commands and infrastructure. |
| HTTP | Microsoft.Extensions.Http + `HttpClient` | Used by the shared TimePro API client. |
| JSON | System.Text.Json | CLI JSON output, config files, and API DTO serialization. |
| MCP | ModelContextProtocol | Exposes selected TimePro operations over stdio for local agents. |
| Unit tests | xUnit, FluentAssertions, NSubstitute | Fast logic tests. |
| Integration tests | xUnit, WireMock.Net | Command/API integration without live TimePro calls. |
| Packaging | `dotnet pack` / global tool install | Outputs a local NuGet package for installation. |

## Project Shape

The repo uses Vertical Slice Architecture for user-facing features:

```text
src/SSW.TimePro.Cli/
├── Program.cs
├── Features/
│   ├── Auth/
│   ├── Tenants/
│   ├── Timesheets/
│   ├── Leave/
│   ├── Scrum/
│   ├── Mcp/
│   └── ...
├── Infrastructure/
│   ├── ApiClient/
│   ├── Config/
│   ├── DependencyInjection/
│   └── Output/
└── Shared/Models/
```

Each CLI command lives with its feature area and owns its settings, validation, API calls, and rendering path. Shared cross-cutting code stays in `Infrastructure/`.

## Design Patterns

- Vertical Slice Architecture: commands are grouped by feature rather than by technical layer.
- Single shared API client: `TimeProApiClient` owns HTTP calls, authentication headers, and endpoint-specific request/response code.
- DTO-first boundaries: API shapes live under `Shared/Models/` and are kept separate from command settings.
- Dual output paths: commands use `OutputHelper` so `--json` writes raw JSON and human output stays Spectre-rendered.
- Local configuration service: `ConfigService` reads and writes global config, tenant config, and repo mappings.
- MCP tool facade: MCP tools call the same infrastructure as CLI commands instead of duplicating API plumbing.
- Agentic-first interface: the CLI is optimized for agents and scripted automation that can run shell commands, inspect files, use Git, and combine TimePro with adjacent project context.

## Configuration and Secrets

Runtime configuration is stored under `~/.config/timepro-cli/`:

```text
~/.config/timepro-cli/
├── config.json
├── tenants/
│   └── {id}.json
└── repo-mappings.json
```

Tenant config contains the TimePro API key. Commands that display tenant details must not serialize or print the API key. Use `TenantConfig.ToSummary()` or another explicit safe view for user-facing JSON.

Project secrets for development should come from environment variables loaded by `direnv`; do not commit plaintext secret files.

## Main Runtime Flows

### CLI command

1. Spectre.Console.Cli parses the command and settings.
2. The command loads config through `IConfigService`.
3. The command validates required tenant and employee context.
4. The command calls `TimeProApiClient` if live TimePro data is needed.
5. The command writes either Spectre output or raw JSON.

### MCP tool

1. `tp mcp` starts a stdio MCP host.
2. Tool classes under `Features/Mcp/Tools/` expose selected operations.
3. Tools load config and call the shared API client.
4. Tools return serialized JSON to the MCP host.

## API Boundary

`TimeProApiClient` is the single HTTP boundary for TimePro. It sets these request headers:

| Header | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `x-timepro-tenant-id` | Active tenant config |
| `x-timepro-api-key` | Active tenant config |
| `x-timepro-api-name` | App name from tenant config |

Do not spread TimePro HTTP calls through feature commands. Add new API methods to `TimeProApiClient` and cover them with WireMock integration tests.

## Documentation

- [README.md](../README.md) is the user entry point and command reference.
- [Instructions-Compile.md](Instructions-Compile.md) explains how to build and run the project locally.
- [Instructions-Deployment.md](Instructions-Deployment.md) explains packaging and installation.
- [Business.md](Business.md) explains the purpose, problem, goals, and intent.
- [Testing-Strategy.md](Testing-Strategy.md) describes unit, integration, and E2E test coverage.
- [Alternative-Solutions-Considered.md](Alternative-Solutions-Considered.md) records why CLI-first was chosen over MCP-only or website-first approaches.
- [accounting.md](accounting.md) documents read-only accounting commands.

Use ADRs under `docs/adrs/` when a decision is high impact, costly to reverse, or needs review context. Keep routine implementation notes in the pull request or issue instead.
